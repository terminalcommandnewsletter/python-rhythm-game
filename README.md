# python-rhythm-game
This is a Rhythm game that I've made using Python. There's a bug when playing in the Terminal which allows you to get insanely high scores. Try to find it.

## **UPDATE** - 16th April, 2022:
This has been completely a _**feature**_ update.
- Seeds can be generated and played for random re-playable and sharable levels.
- Many modes namely, the default song, custom seed, 
randomly generated level with player specified number _(with limits)_ of instructions and randomly generated level with a random number _(with limits)_ of instructions.
- Config options added so that the game can be configured easily.

Find the video showing a demo of it below:
